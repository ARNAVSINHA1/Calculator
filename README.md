**React Calculator**<br>
This is a simple calculator app built with React. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.<br>

**Features**<br>
<ul>
<li>Perform basic math operations: +, -, *, /</li>
<li>Clear the running calculation at any time</li>
<li>Delete previous number character-by-character</li>
<li>Responsive grid-based keypad</li>
<li>Shows calculation error for invalid operations</li>
</ul>
**Usage**<br>
<ul>
<li>Enter numbers by clicking the numeric buttons</li>
<li>Select mathematical operations using the operator buttons (+, -, *, /)</li>
<li>Click the "=" button to evaluate the calculation</li>
<li>Clear the running calculation using the "C" and "Clear" buttons</li>
<li>The keypad auto-scales across screen sizes</li>
<li>This calculator was built using React hooks and state to manage the running calculation value. It has a grid-based keypad layout powered by CSS Grid for responsiveness.</li>
</ul><br>
Overall this project demonstrates building an interactive app in React while managing state across user input.
